# Words You Know - a personal dictionary. 
# Overview
This application is dedicated for people who are learning foreign languages. It is intended to help in learning new vocabulary by enabling the user to create their own dictionary. I was learning languages myself and I found it difficult to find an app that will let me organize every single word I have learned. Words You Know intends to solve this problem, by allowing the user to have their words always accessible via their personal profile. 

## Features
* **User Accounts:** Each user will be able to create their own personal profile with their own dictionary and view it after logging in.
* **Adding words to a word bank:** Users can organize what they learn by adding new words - with definitions - to their word bank.
* **Deleteing words from a word bank:** Users can delete the words that were previously added to the database.
* **Search:** Users can search in the real-time for their words in both languages.
